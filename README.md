A basic Java Applet project developed using Java 8 and Swing components, demonstrating the creation of interactive GUI applets. This project serves as an educational example of legacy applet programming and GUI design.

Why Java 8 and Applets?

-Java 8 is stable, widely used, and supports Swing well.

-Applets are a core part of Java GUI history, useful for learning legacy Java concepts.

-Swing makes interactive user interfaces for applets, which run in applet viewers or browsers (older ones).
Features

Uses Java 8 environment:

-Shows basic applet lifecycle: init(), start(), paint(), stop()

-Uses Swing buttons, labels, and text fields

-Simple UI to learn applet programming

-Runs in applet viewer or embedded in HTML (only supported by older browsers
